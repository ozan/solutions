# Clock

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

Create a clock that is independent of date.

You should be able to add and subtract minutes to it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.
