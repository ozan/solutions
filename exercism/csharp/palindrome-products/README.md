# Palindrome Products

Write a program that can detect palindrome products in a given range.

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure you're exercise file you're submitting is in the `exercism/csharp/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.cs` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/csharp/bob/bob.cs`.
