# Meetup

Calculate the date of meetups.

Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.

Examples are

- the first Monday
- the third Tuesday
- the Wednesteenth
- the last Thursday

Note that "Monteenth", "Tuesteenth", etc are all made up words. There
was a meetup whose members realised that there are exactly 7 days that
end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week
(Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth'
in every month.

## Running Tests

Use `runhaskell` (included in the Haskell Platform) to compile and run your
Haskell code.

    $ runhaskell -Wall bob_test.hs
