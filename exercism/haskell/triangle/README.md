# Triangle

Write a program that can tell you if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

The program should raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.

Tests are provided, delete one `skip` at a time.

## Hint

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the
length of the third side, a principle known as the _triangle
inequality_.

## Running Tests

Use `runhaskell` (included in the Haskell Platform) to compile and run your
Haskell code.

    $ runhaskell -Wall bob_test.hs
