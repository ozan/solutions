# Queen Attack

Write a program that positions two queens on a chess board and indicates whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.

In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same
row, column, or diagonal.

A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.

So if you're told the white queen is at (2, 3) and the black queen at
(5, 6), then you'd know you've got a set-up like so:

```plain
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ W _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ B _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
```

You'd also be able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.
In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces
share a diagonal.
