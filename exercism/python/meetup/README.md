# Meetup

Calculate the date of meetups.

Typically meetups happen on the same day of the week.

Examples are

- the first Monday
- the third Tuesday
- the Wednesteenth
- the last Thursday

Note that "Monteenth", "Tuesteenth", etc are all made up words. There
was a meetup whose members realised that there are exactly 7 days that
end in '-teenth'. Therefore, one is guaranteed that each day of the week
(Monday, Tuesday, ...) will have exactly one date that is named with '-teenth'
in every month.

### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `bob.py` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/bob/bob.py`.


For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).
