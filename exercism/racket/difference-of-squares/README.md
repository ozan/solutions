# Difference Of Squares

Find the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sums of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

Hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first
ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares is 2640:

    3025 - 385 = 2640

You can run the provided tests through DrRacket, or via the command line.

To run the test through DrRacket, simply open the test file and click the 'Run' button in the upper right.

To run the test from the command line, simply run the test from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called `hello-world-test.rkt`, you can run the following command:

```
raco test hello-world-test.rkt
```

which will display the following:

```
raco test: (submod "hello-world-test.rkt" test)
2 success(es) 0 failure(s) 0 error(s) 2 test(s) run
0
2 tests passed
```
