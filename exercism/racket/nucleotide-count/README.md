# Nucleotide Count

Given a DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C',
'G', and 'T'.

Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the
particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:

- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as
- amino acids are to proteins as
- sugar is to starch as
- oh crap lipids

I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.

So back to nucleotides.

DNA contains four types of them: adenine (`A`), cytosine (`C`), guanine
(`G`), and thymine (`T`).

RNA contains a slightly different set of nucleotides, but we don't care
about that for now.

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism Racket page](http://exercism.io/languages/racket).

You can run the provided tests through DrRacket, or via the command line.

To run the test through DrRacket, simply open the test file and click the 'Run' button in the upper right.

To run the test from the command line, simply run the test from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called `hello-world-test.rkt`, you can run the following command:

```
raco test hello-world-test.rkt
```

which will display the following:

```
raco test: (submod "hello-world-test.rkt" test)
2 success(es) 0 failure(s) 0 error(s) 2 test(s) run
0
2 tests passed
```
