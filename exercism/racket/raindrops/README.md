# Raindrops

Write a program that converts a number to a string, the contents of which depends on the number's prime factors.

- If the number contains 3 as a prime factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number contains 5 as a prime factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number contains 7 as a prime factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a prime factor,
  just pass the number's digits straight through.

## Examples

- 28's prime-factorization is 2, 2, 7.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 1755 prime-factorization is 3, 3, 3, 5, 13.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- The prime factors of 34 are 2 and 17.
  - Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that,
    so it just goes with the straightforward "34".

You can run the provided tests through DrRacket, or via the command line.

To run the test through DrRacket, simply open the test file and click the 'Run' button in the upper right.

To run the test from the command line, simply run the test from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called `hello-world-test.rkt`, you can run the following command:

```
raco test hello-world-test.rkt
```

which will display the following:

```
raco test: (submod "hello-world-test.rkt" test)
2 success(es) 0 failure(s) 0 error(s) 2 test(s) run
0
2 tests passed
```
