# Hello World

Write a function that greets the user by name, or by saying "Hello, World!" if no name is given.

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language.

**Note:** You can skip this exercise by running:

    exercism skip $LANGUAGE hello-world

## Specification

Write a `Hello World!` function that can greet someone given their name.
The function should return the appropriate greeting.

For an input of "Alice", the response should be "Hello, Alice!".

If a name is not given, the response should be "Hello, World!"

## Test-Driven Development

As programmers mature, they eventually want to test their code.

Here at Exercism we simulate [Test-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD), where you write your tests before writing any functionality. The simulation comes in the form of a pre-written test suite, which will signal that you have solved the problem.

It will also provide you with a safety net to explore other solutions without breaking the functionality.

### A typical TDD workflow on Exercism:

1. Run the test file and pick one test that's failing.
2. Write some code to fix the test you picked.
3. Re-run the tests to confirm the test is now passing.
4. Repeat from step 1.
5. Submit your solution (`exercism submit /path/to/file`)

## Instructions

Submissions are encouraged to be general, within reason. Having said that, it's also important not to over-engineer a solution.

It's important to remember that the goal is to make code as expressive and readable as we can. However, solutions to the hello-world exercise will not be reviewed by a person, but by rikki- the robot, who will offer an encouraging word.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the
[C page](http://exercism.io/languages/c) on the Exercism site. This covers
the basic information on setting up the development environment expected
by the exercises.


## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development][3-tdd-rules].

The included makefile can be used to create and run the tests using the `test`
task.

    make test

Create just the functions you need to satisfy any compiler errors and get the
test to fail. Then write just enough code to get the test to pass. Once you've
done that, move onto the next test.

[3-tdd-rules]: http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd

As you progress through the tests, take the time to refactor your
implementation for readability and expressiveness and then go on to the next
test.

Try to use standard C99 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.
