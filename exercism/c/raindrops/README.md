# Raindrops

Write a program that converts a number to a string, the contents of which depends on the number's factors.

- If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a factor,
  just pass the number's digits straight through.

## Examples

- 28's prime-factorization is 2, 2, 7.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 1755 prime-factorization is 3, 3, 3, 5, 13.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- The prime factors of 34 are 2 and 17.
  - Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that,
    so it just goes with the straightforward "34".

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the
[C page](http://exercism.io/languages/c) on the Exercism site. This covers
the basic information on setting up the development environment expected
by the exercises.


## Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the [three
rules of test-driven development][3-tdd-rules].

The included makefile can be used to create and run the tests using the `test`
task.

    make test

Create just the functions you need to satisfy any compiler errors and get the
test to fail. Then write just enough code to get the test to pass. Once you've
done that, move onto the next test.

As you progress through the tests, take the time to refactor your
implementation for readability and expressiveness and then go on to the next
test.

Try to use standard C99 facilities in preference to writing your own
low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.
