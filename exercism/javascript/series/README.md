# Series

Write a program that will take a string of digits and give you all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in that string.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- 491
- 914
- 142

And the following 4-digit series:

- 4914
- 9142

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve
whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions*
in the input; the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine-node .

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
